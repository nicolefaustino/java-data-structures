# Java Stack Implementation Sample

## Overview
This Java program demonstrates the basic operations of a Stack data structure using Java's built-in `Stack` class from the `java.util` package. A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top.

## Features
- **Push Operation**: Adding elements to the top of the stack
- **Pop Operation**: Removing elements from the top of the stack
- **Peek Operation**: Viewing the topmost element without removing it
- **isEmpty Check**: Verifying if the stack has any elements

## Implementation Details
- Uses Java's built-in `Stack<Integer>` class
- Demonstrates pushing multiple elements onto the stack
- Shows how to access the top element using `peek()`
- Illustrates emptying the stack while displaying each element

## Stack Applications
- Function call management (call stack)
- Expression evaluation
- Syntax parsing
- Undo mechanisms in applications
- Browser history management
